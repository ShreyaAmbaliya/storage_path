# StoragePath

A flutter plugin to get all images, audios, videos and files location path in json format based on [StoragePath](https://github.com/follow2vivek/StoragePath).

> **Only for Android.**
>
> _On IOS will just give you an empty array i.e. []_

###### pubspec.yaml

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_storage_path: ^1.0.4
```

###### example.dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter_storage_path/flutter_storage_path.dart';
```

```dart
    try {
      imagePath = await StoragePath.imagesPath; //contains images path and folder name in json format
    } on PlatformException {
      imagesPath = 'Failed to get path';
    }
    
```

Similarly

```dart
    videoPath = await StoragePath.videoPath; //this will return videos path
    audioPath = await StoragePath.audioPath; //this will return audios path
    filePath = await StoragePath.filePath; //this will return files path

```
